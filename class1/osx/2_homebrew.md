### Install Homebrew

Now that your Terminal is setup, it's time to install [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/), the de facto package manager for OS X.

To start, run the following command:

```
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/go/install)"
```

Make sure to agree when asked to install the **XCode CommandLine Tools**.


### Update Homebrew

If you've previously installed Homebrew, now is a good time to update it by running:

```
brew update
```


### Verify Homebrew

To verify Homebrew is installed correctly, run the following command:

```
brew doctor
```

And you'll see something like this:

```
Your system is ready to brew.
```
