### Install Git

You'll also need [Git](http://git-scm.com/), the version control system of choice among developers.

To install Git, run the following command:

```
brew install git
```

To verify Git is installed correctly, run the following command:

```
git --version
```

And you'll see something like this:

```
git version 2.0.1
```
