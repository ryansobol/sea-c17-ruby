### Update APT

First, you need to update Ubuntu's **Advanced Packaging Tool** (APT).

To start, launch the **Terminal** app and run the following command:

```
sudo apt-get update
```

Next, you need to install some dependencies:

```
sudo apt-get install git-core curl zlib1g-dev build-essential libssl-dev libreadline-dev libyaml-dev libsqlite3-dev sqlite3 libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev python-software-properties
```
