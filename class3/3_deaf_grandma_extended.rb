# What if Grandma doesnâ€™t want you to leave? When you shout BYE, she could
# pretend not to hear you. Change your previous program so that you have to
# shout BYE three times in a row. Make sure to test your program: if you shout
# BYE three times but not in a row, you should still be talking to Grandma.
