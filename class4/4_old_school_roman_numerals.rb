# In the early days of Roman numerals, the Romans didn't bother with any of this
# new-fangled subtraction "IX" nonsense. No sir, it was straight addition,
# biggest to littlest - so 9 was written "VIIII" and so on.
#
# Write a method that, when passed any integer between 1 and 3000, it returns a
# string containing the proper old-school Roman numeral. In other words:
#
#   old_roman_numeral(9)
#
# should return
#
#   "VIIII"
#
# Make sure to test your method on a bunch of different numbers like 1999.
#
# Hint 1: Use the integer division and modulus methods on page 32.
#
# Hint 2: Here's a mapping of Roman to Arabic numerals:
#
#   I = 1
#   V = 5
#   X = 10
#   L = 50
#   C = 100
#   D = 500
#   M = 1000
#
# Hint 3: Run the program from the shell like this:
#
#   $ ruby 4_old_school_roman_numerals.rb 9
#   VIIII
