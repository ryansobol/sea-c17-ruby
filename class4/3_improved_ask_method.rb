# That ask method I showed you on page 66 was OK, but I bet you could do better.
# Try to clean it up by removing the answer variable. Youâ€™ll have to use return
# to exit from the loop. (Well, it will get you out of the whole method, but it
# will get you out of the loop in the process.)
#
# Hint: I've already structured your program. Aren't you lucky? :)
